# redux-tutorial-series

Welcome to the Redux Tutorial Series repository! This repository contains the source code for a series of video tutorials covering Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Overview

This series is divided into multiple videos, each focusing on different aspects of Redux and its integration with JavaScript & React. In each video, we build a Redux-powered application from scratch, covering fundamental concepts, best practices, and advanced techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with each video's code, navigate to the respective directory (`video-1`, `video-2`, etc.), and follow the instructions provided in the README.md file
